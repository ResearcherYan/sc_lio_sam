# sc_lio_sam
A fork from [SC-LIO-SAM](https://github.com/gisbi-kim/SC-LIO-SAM) with a few minor modifications.

## Highlights
- Plenty annotations in the code.
- Make the code structure more readable.
- Make the icp process mathematically correct, which don't hurt the result. Just make it easier to understand.
- Save more files used for the downstream localization.
- Add dense map saving function.
- [Add calibration transformation matrix computing scripts](calib/calib.py).
